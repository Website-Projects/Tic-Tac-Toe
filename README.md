# Tic-tac-toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game but with a twist. It has more 700 squares to play, make 5 X or O in a row,column, or diagonal to win the game. If you can help with my todo list or have new idea for the app, please feel free to make a pull request.

Todo lists:

1: implement win logic on both side of the diagonal. Right now it only works from left to right. Not from right to left.

2. Make it mobile and tablet responsive.

3. Design a logo and place it on top of the game for decorative purposes.
